# Savior_backup
Java application to automatically back files up to dropbox

The objective was to have a simple solution for clients who wanted to back up data (for example a student who wants to keep his thesis safe). It needed to run on a variety of systems including linux and mac. Everything that happened needed to be reported via e-mail, including errors.
Dropbox was chosen for the safe yet simple api and support. Written in Java so that only 1 version could be run everywhere.
